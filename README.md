So here's the deal. I have this really bad habit of "collecting" files. Movies, Music, you name it. They end up scattered on drives. Sometimes I try to organize those files by copying them into a new folder, but then I never finish and my files end up existing in multiple locations. Sometimes I try to rename the files in that new folder, but keep the old files in the old folder for other programs to read. More duplication.

I was thinking... why don't I just deal with files the same way gmail deals with emails?
